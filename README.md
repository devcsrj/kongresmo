# Kongresmo

Although the Philippine Government has made legislations available through their respective online portals, 
visualizing the progress of a bill remains a challenge. To determine a particular bill's status and timeline, 
it requires the typical Filipino citizen to trawl and plot massive data from:

* [House of Representatives](congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=bills)
* [Senate of the Philippines](https://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/leg_sys.aspx)

*Kongresmo* aims to solve this challenge by providing a one-stop, intuitive app for viewing, and tracking  
legislations authored by the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives.
